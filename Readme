- 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis.rmd: R Markdown file conducting EDA to uncover patterns and anomalies.
- 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis.docx: Document summarizing EDA findings.
- 3 - Feature Engineering+Modelling.Rmd: R Markdown file detailing feature engineering and model development.
- 3 - Feature-Engineering+Modelling.docx: Document summarizing modeling approaches and results.
- Final Project Documentation.docx: Comprehensive report covering methodology, findings, and strategic recommendations.
- IST687 M004 Group1 Presentation.pptx: Slide deck used for the project presentation.

Software Requirements:
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio
- R packages: shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, forecast, lubridate

How to Open/Review:
1. Open RStudio.
2. Load the `.Rmd` files to review the code and analyses.
3. Execute the R Markdown files to generate corresponding HTML reports.
